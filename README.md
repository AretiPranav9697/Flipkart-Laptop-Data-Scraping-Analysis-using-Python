# Flipkart-Laptop-Data-Scraping-Analysis-using-Python
Built an automated web-scraping pipeline using Python, Requests, BeautifulSoup, and Regex to extract laptop details (Brand, Title, RAM, SSD, Processor Generation, Ratings, and Price) from Flipkart.  
Scraped and processed data from 30 pages (several hundred products) while implementing custom headers to bypass request blocking.
Performed data cleaning and transformation using Pandas to standardize inconsistent formats (RAM, SSD, ratings, processor generation, etc.).
Created a structured DataFrame and exported it into a CSV dataset for further analytics and machine-learning tasks.
Validated scraping quality by checking data completeness (length of lists, missing values, mismatches).
Implemented logic to handle dynamic content and inconsistent HTML patterns on Flipkart product pages.
Prepared the cleaned dataset for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and later visualization in tools like Power BI or Python.
