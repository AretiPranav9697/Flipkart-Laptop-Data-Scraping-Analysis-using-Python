# Flipkart-Laptop-Data-Scraping-Analysis-using-Python
Built an automated web-scraping pipeline using Python, Requests, BeautifulSoup, and Regex to extract laptop details (Brand, Title, RAM, SSD, Processor Generation, Ratings, and Price) from Flipkart.  Scraped and processed data from 30 pages (several hundred products) while implementing custom headers to bypass request blocking.
